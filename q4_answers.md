A.
Call 1: in1 = [1,2,3,4], in1->next = llrec([5,6], [2,3,4]), new in1=[1,2,6,3,3,4]
Call 2: in1 = [2,3,4], in1->next = llrec([2,3,4], [6]), new in1 = [2,6,3,3,4]
Call 3: in1 = [6], in1->next = llrec([6], [3,4]), new in1 =[6,3,3,4]
Call 4: in1 = [3,4], in1->next = llrec([3,4], null) = [3,4], new in1 = [3,3,4]
Call 5: return in1 ([3,4])

B. This will return a pointer to the address of variable n2, since the first exit condition is triggered by n1 being equal to a null pointer.
